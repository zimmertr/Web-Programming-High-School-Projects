#High School Programming Projects - Circa 2008-2009

##Foreward
**PLEASE BE AWARE THAT I WAS 14 YEARS OLD WHILE MAKING THESE PROJECTS**

These projects do not use current technology, reflect a good programming methodology or understanding, or use modern subject matter. I simply put thse on GitHub as a friendly reminder to myself of where I came from as well as a `trophy` of sorts to demonstrate how long computer programming has been an important part of my life. 

##Summary
This repository is a collection of my homework, projects, and labs from my computer programming class in high school around 2008. These projects use technologies such as HTML and Macromedia Flash

##Macromedia Flash

A long time ago Adobe has a product called Macromedia Flash which you could use to create flash programs for websites. With the death of Flash Player, the program no longer exists but if you install the Flash Player plugin into a browser you can open these files up and see the animations still.

###Flash Eyes

A simple project where clouds move across the sky and the black blob's eyes look left and right.

###Going to Class

A crude animation that was supposed to be me moving in from the left side of the screen, opening my locker, grabbing some books, and going through the door to class. Only half of it was completed.

###Shape Tween

When the gif begins, there are four objects. The words `OMG` and `LOL` and two other objects. The objects morph and switch places. The animation was too fast to capture a good screenshot so I gave up.

##HTML

Pete's Pets is a website that everyone in our class was responsible for recreating based on a textbook example of using HTML. We were allowed as much creative influence as we could think of, But if I remember correctly, the core requirements were:

- At least 4 pages
- Use a `sendto` for email
- Link to a spreadsheet and a document
- Integrate with Google Maps.
